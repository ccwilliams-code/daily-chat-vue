# Daily pre-built + TalkJS

Extended Chat Functionality POC

This demo shows how easily you can extend the Daily pre-built library's chat functionality by importing a third-party chat api.

To use this demo, you will first need to [create a Daily account](https://dashboard.daily.co/signup). You will need your Daily API key, which can be found on the [Developers](https://dashboard.daily.co/developers) page, if you want to create new rooms through the demo UI.

After that is set up, open two incognito browser windows (or grab a friend and share your room link!) and log in as two separate users. After the second user logs in, you'll see a hyperlink appear at the bottom containing a list of participants currently in the call. You can click on their name to start a chat with them! You can then type your messages and send them in a one-on-one chat using the TalkJS Inbox/Chat widget on the right side of your screen.

Additional information on setting up the TalkJS Chat component can be found [here](https://talkjs.com/docs/Getting_Started/). In short, you'll need to sign up for a TalkJS account and get your API key as described there.

## Requirements

To use this demo, you will first need to [create a Daily account](https://dashboard.daily.co/signup). You will need your Daily API key, which can be found on the [Developers](https://dashboard.daily.co/developers) page, if you want to create new rooms through the demo UI.

You can use existing Daily rooms in the demo by pasting the room URL into the input. The room URL should be in this format to be valid: `https://domain-name.daily.co/room-name`, with `daily-domain` changed to your domain, and `room-name` changed to the name of the existing room you would like to use.
